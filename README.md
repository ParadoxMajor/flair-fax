## User Flair Breakdown

The current mod page for userflairs (https://www.reddit.com/mod/.../flairedusers) has no order, and sometimes mods want to see a breakdown of the flairs assigned, with a list of users who have each. This form will display such a breakdown. On larger subs, this is an intensive scan, so you may need to start the scan and then check back until it's done (with some progress displayed in between).
